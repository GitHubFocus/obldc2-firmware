This project aims to create a fully open-source Brushless Drive Controller.

Where is the hardware
---------------------
The hardware design files got split into a separate repository on github called
open-bldc-hardware.

Goal of obldc2
--------------
The old codebase is quite stale and convoluted. In an effort of cleanup and simplification obldc2 is starting on a rather clean slate.

Supporting only the strip hardware but reusing some of the features and tools contained in open-bldc repository.

This repository only contains the firmwre for the motor controller. If there are libraries used they will be included as submodules in the future. (just like libopencm3 is included currently).

Licensing
---------
All sourcecode is licensed under GPL version 3 or later, all circuitry designs
and pcb layouts are available as original source files and licensed under
CreativeCommons BY-SA 3.0.

Feel free to use everything here as you wish! :)
